# Programming Tutorials from the "Fullstack Vue" Book

## Setup

Please refer to the first chapter in the book for instructions on setting up your environment with Node & npm.

## Installing packages for all projects

You can install all the packages for all the projects up front, saving you time in the future. To do so, from this directory:

```
npm i
npm run install-all
```

Unless you have a quantum computer connected directly to an Amazon data center, this task will take a long time to complete.
